##**Description of the project**

This project is complete web application composed of: 
- A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell (perfect for development and debugging)<br />
- A website (the front-end) that shows the final product to everybody: static and dynamic <br />
- A database or files that store data (data = objects) <br />
- An API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and your data (retrieve, create, delete, update them) <br />

##**Expected final product**

##**Description of the command interpreter**
The cmd interpreter provides a simple framework for writing line-oriented command interpreters. <br />
It can be used for for test harnesses, administrative tools, and prototypes <br />

####**How to start it**
The cmd module contains one public class, `Cmd` designed to be used as a base class for command processors such as interactive shells and other command interpreters. <br />
By default it uses readline for interactive prompt handling, command line editing, and command completion.<br />

####**How to use it**
It can be used to:
- Processing Commands
- Command Arguments
- Live Help
- Auto-Completion
- Overriding Base Class Methods
- Configuring Cmd Through Attributes
- Shelling Out
